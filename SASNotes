1. Intro
1.1 Types of Models
1) designed experiments 
2) sample surveys
3) observational studies
- factor, levels, effects (different levels of a factor)

1.2 Statistical Models
- Two Parts:
1) relating response to all explanatory variables
2) description of the probability distribution assumed to characterize random variation affecting observed response.
- means model
Effect of drug A as αΑ : μΑ = μ + αΑ  
Effects Model : YA = μ + αΑ + e
Over-parameterized model : sum to zero constraint if number of observations per treatment is zero.
